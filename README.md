# Algolia workshop

The goal of this workshop will be to create a sample application using Algolia.
For this example, we'll use a Bordeaux related dataset: approximately 1000 wine bottles from the area.

The workshop is split into two parts, one for node, and one for rails, but we will end up with a very similar project.

## requirements

To follow this workshop without needing to install a lot, we suggest you use: 

* node v4 or higher for the node workshop
* ruby >= v2.2.2 or rvm to install it for the rails workshop

## Getting started

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/algolia/hack-bdx
$ cd hack-bdx
$ # now either
$ git checkout node
$ # or for rails:
$ git checkout rails
```
